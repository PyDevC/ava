A hyperparameter is a parameter of the model whose value influences the 
learning process and whose value cannot be estimated from the training data. 
Hyperparameters are configured externally before starting the model 
learning/training process. Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the 
optimal hyperparameters for any given machine learning algorithm.

There are various hyperparameter automation techniques.

- [[Hyperband]]
- [[gradient-based-optimization]]
- [[grid-search]]
- [[random-search]]
