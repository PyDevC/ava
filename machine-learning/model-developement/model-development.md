For developing a machine learning model we require huge amount of data.
Next step is to take parameters of the dataset as input for the model. Not all
the parameters are useful so, we require feature extraction techniues. Then 
comes the step of establishing the relationship between meta data and the 
extracted features. Last step is train the model and tune it.
